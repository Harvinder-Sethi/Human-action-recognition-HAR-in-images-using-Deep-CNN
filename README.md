# Human-action-recognition-HAR-in-images-using-Deep-CNN
Human action recognition (HAR) using still images. we have develop a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify the actions of a person from still images. The actions we are interested in is categorised in to 21 types belonging to 5 classes.
